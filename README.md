#Hey, look! It's my portfolio!

I keep some of my pretty things here for your perusal.

###Let's get started

This site uses 'npm' (`5.3.0`) to manage dev dependencies and `grunt` to concatenate CSS files.

###Let's run this thing

1. Clone the repo
2. Make sure you have `node` installed globally on your machine
2. Install `npm` with `npm install`
4. run `grunt`
